## 🎯 Mission

**Make research accessible to everyone — not just experts.**

Research is the engine of innovation, but the traditional PDF format holds it back:

* Hard to navigate
* Unfriendly on mobile
* Dense jargon and layout complexity

Readify elevates research into a format that is:

* Searchable
* Navigable
* Understandable
* Shareable

## 👤 Who is Readify for?

* **Students** trying to learn difficult concepts
* **Developers & engineers** exploring new fields
* **Indie researchers** seeking clarity
* **Educators** preparing course resources
* **Anyone** curious about emerging tech & science

> If a paper seems like a wall of text — Readify turns it into a guided tour.
